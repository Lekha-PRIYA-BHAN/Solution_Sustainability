For the Azure service: {service}, provide a detailed model / formula of how to compute an estimate of the carbon cloud footprint leveraging the knowledge about the service. 
        Make required assumptions for the input parameters of the model and then provide an estimate of the carbon cloud footprint of the component. 
        Ensure you clearly describe the model parameters, the assumptions on their values, the formula(s), and the computation of the estimate using the formula(s). 
        The parameters of the model / formula must include datacenter PUE and carbon intensity among others. 
        The output must be organized in only and only the following 'Description of model', 'Model Parameters', 'Assumptions', 'Formulas', 'Computation', 'Total Emission' and 'Conclusion'. 
        The 'Total Emission' must be in the following format: '<value>' where <value> is an intiger value without any strings, for Example "Total Emission": "1234".
        The output must be in JSON format, only in valid JSON format to allow for digital processing"


For component <Azure Active Directory>, provide a detailed list of parameters that can be used to create a formula or model to compute an estimate of the carbon cloud footprint leveraging the knowledge about the service. Ensure to clearly list the parameters and assumed values in intiger. 
The output must be in simple JSON without nesting.
The parameters of the model / formula must include datacenter PUE and Carbon Intensity in kgCO2/kWh. Provide assumed values for this parameter.
The parameters of the model / formula must include the <component> specific parameters that can affect the carbon footprint. Provide assumed values for these parameters.
Include all the assumed values in the JSON.
One of the key in the JSON must be the "Component". All other key in the JSON must be key value pair, where the value is always an intiger.
The output must be in JSON format, only in valid JSON format without any additional explanation to allow for digital processing

For the following component given in the below JSON, calculate the carbon footprint in kgCO2 for an year,
The output must be in JSON format, only in valid JSON format without any additional explanation to allow for digital processing.
The output must have only 3 key value pairs. 1. Component 2. carbon footprint in kgCO2, 3. formula used to calculate.
